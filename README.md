# Data Science Tools
In this repo, I will try to develop a complete pipeline for data science projects. You can use my code freely via running the code below:

```
git clone https://github.com/arm-on/dstools/
```

# Ongoing:
- Loading different formats (CSV, JSON, TXT)
- Writing variables to different file formats (CSV, JSON, TXT)
- Splitting the data into train, test, and development sets
